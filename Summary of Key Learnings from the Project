## Summary of Key Learnings from the Project

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

- **Handling Missing Values:** Effectively handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, mode, imputation methods) based on data characteristics.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Ensured data consistency by converting variables to correct data types.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling:** Identified and addressed outliers in numerical variables using techniques like box plots and statistical methods.

**Descriptive Statistics:**

- **Central Tendency:** Calculated mean, median, and mode to understand the central values of key variables.
- **Dispersion:** Calculated variance and standard deviation to measure the spread of data.
- **Data Distribution:** Analyzed data distribution using histograms, box plots, and density plots.

**Probability Distributions:**

- **Binomial and Normal Distributions:** Identified suitable probability distributions for relevant variables and calculated probabilities and expected values.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations (e.g., histograms, density plots) to understand the shape and characteristics of the distributions.

**Customer Segmentation:**

- **RFM Analysis:** Utilized RFM analysis to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- **Customer Insights:** Identified key characteristics and behaviors of different customer segments.
- **Recommendations:** Provided actionable recommendations based on customer segmentation, such as targeting high-value customers and re-engaging less active ones.

**Data Visualization:**

- **Effective Visualization:** Created clear and informative visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, pie charts) to represent key findings.
- **Customization:** Customized visualizations using techniques like color schemes, labels, and annotations to enhance readability and understanding.

**Overall Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Proficiency in handling missing data, data types, and outliers.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Ability to calculate descriptive statistics, identify probability distributions, and conduct basic statistical tests.
- **Data Visualization:** Skill in creating effective and informative visualizations to communicate findings.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Understanding of customer segmentation techniques and ability to analyze customer behavior.
- **Problem-Solving:** Demonstrated problem-solving skills by addressing challenges encountered during the analysis.
